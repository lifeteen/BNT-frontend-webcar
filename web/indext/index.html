                                Although the frist sports cars were derived from fast tourers,and early sporting regulations often demanded four seats(evem three -seaters were ofter produced by coachbuilders),two seats became common from about the mid-1920s.Modern sports cars may also have small back seats that are often reall only suitable for luggage or small chirdrenlsuch a configuration is referred to as a 2+2(two full seats+tow"occasional" seats).

                                Over the years,some manufacturers of sports cars have sought to increase the practicality of their vehicles by increasing the seating room.One method is to place the driver's seat in the center of the car ,which allows two full -sized passenger seats on each side and slightly behind the driver.The arrangement was originally considered for the Lamborghini Miura,but abandoned as impractial because of the difficuty for the driver to enter/exit the vehicle.McLaren used the design in their F1.
